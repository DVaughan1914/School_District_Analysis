# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The school board has a suspicion of academic dishonesty for the ninth grade testing scores at a particular school (Thomas High Schoo). As a result they want to have an analyis done on the entire school district to see the testing schore or math and reading. But they want to exclude the scores of the ninth graders from Thomas high school to keep ther academic integrity in tact. We were charged to exclude/remove those testing scores from that school for the ninth graders to see where the district falls as a reasult. Using data analytical techniques we excluded those grtates and ran a summary on the entire school district passing and failing grades and percentages for math and reading.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
- How is the district summary affected? The district summary was minimally affected in a negative way by excluding the nith graders of Thomas High school grades. 
- -  The initial dataset had no grades recorded for the those ninth grade students. Normally they would be given a failing grade (60% or below) which would have dropped the overall passing numbers and percantages of the entire district. But since we excluded these failing grades, it was as if they did not exist.

- How is the school summary affected? The school summary was minimally affected by excluding these students grades from the summary and averages. For the same reasons as the school district summary. Our instructions were to ommit the ninth graders scores from the total s and summary. So the fact that the 9th graders were excluded this allowed the numbers and percentages for Thomas high school to have a higher percentage of passing.
## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing the 9th graders math and reading scores for Thomas high school actually made the schools passing percantage and numbers go up. As a reasult compared to the other school they were one of the top schools in the district based on the scores.
## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
-Math and reading scores by grade
  By replacing the score by grades we can see where the potential problem is located. The rest of the scores for the entire school actuallay increased the passing percantage.
-Scores by school spending
  The school will ultimately get less money for school spenting.Because these 9th graders were not accounted for in the numbers through their test scores.
-Scores by school size
Thomas high school will have a high score percantage and the school size will be misrepresented because there arent any grades for the 9th graders.
-Scores by school type
With Thomas high school bing a charter school and before the removal of the 9th graders their math and reading scores were one of the lowest percantages. So removing the 9th graders the score's average increased. And it made the scores by school type for the charter school precentage to increased.
## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs. 
- The overall score pecentage for the type of school changed
- The overall score percentage for Thomas High school changed
- The budget for Thomas High school changed 
- The top schools and bottom schools in the analysis changed.
- The spengind limits per student per school changed
